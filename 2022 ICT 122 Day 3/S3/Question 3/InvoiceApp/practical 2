4. Objectives:- To understand the concept of inheritance and how packages help organize classes in Java.

5. Theory / Concept:- 
         This practical focuses on two major concepts in Java:
                  -Inheritance: A fundamental object-oriented concept where one class (Person) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (Human).
        		      -Packages: A way to organize Java classes into namespaces. The Human and Person classes are both part of the Human package, allowing for structured organization and reuse.

6. Algorithm:
       Step1: Create a package named Human.
       Step2: In this package, define a class Human with a method talk(String word) that prints a message.
       Step3: Also in the Human package, create a Person class that extends Human and has a constructor to set the person's name.
       Step4: Create a class App in the default package.
       Step5: Import all classes from the Human package using import Human.*;.
       Step6: In the App class, create an instance of Person, and call the inherited talk() method.
       Step7: Run the program to see the output.
