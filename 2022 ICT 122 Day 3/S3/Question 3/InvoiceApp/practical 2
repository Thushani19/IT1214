4. Objectives:- To understand the concept of inheritance and how packages help organize classes in Java.

5. Theory / Concept:- 
         This practical focuses on two major concepts in Java:
                  -Inheritance: A fundamental object-oriented concept where one class (Person) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (Human).
        	         -Packages: A way to organize Java classes into namespaces. The Human and Person classes are both part of the Human package, allowing for structured organization and reuse.

6. Algorithm:
       Step1: Create a package named Human.
       Step2: In this package, define a class Human with a method talk(String word) that prints a message.
       Step3: Also in the Human package, create a Person class that extends Human and has a constructor to set the person's name.
       Step4: Create a class App in the default package.
       Step5: Import all classes from the Human package using import Human.*;.
       Step6: In the App class, create an instance of Person, and call the inherited talk() method.
       Step7: Run the program to see the output.

 7.Source Code:
     //App.java
           import Human.* ;
      
            class App {
            	public static void main(String[] args) {
            		System.out.println("Welcome to Invoice App");
            		Person shakthy = new Person ("Shakthy") ;
            		shakthy.talk("Hello from Shakthy") ;
            	}
            }

  //Human.java
            package Human ;

            public class Human {
            	public void talk(String word){
            		System.out.println("Human says : "+word);
            	}
            }
 //Person.java
             package Human ;

              public class Person extends Human {
              	String name ;
              	
              	public Person(String name){
              		this.name=name;
              	}
              }

8.Output:  Welcome to Invoice App
           Human says : Hello from Shakthy
9.Observations: 
        1.Error Encountered:
             -If directory structure does not match package name (e.g., Human/Human.java must be inside a Human folder), it results in a compilation error.
        2.If classes are not compiled with proper classpath, the main program may not recognize the package classes.

	 2.Resolution: -Maintained directory structure properly.

   3.Behavior:
        	-The talk() method is inherited from Human to Person and behaves as expected.
      		-Creating a Person object and calling talk() prints the correct message.

10. Conclusion: 
          In this practical, we reinforced our understanding of:
                	-How to use inheritance in Java (Person extending Human)           
                	-Proper creation and importing of user-defined packages   
                	-Calling inherited methods from subclass instances
                	-This promotes better code organization, reuse, and clarity in larger Java projects.
