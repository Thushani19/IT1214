4.Objectives:The objective of this practical is to understand the basic syntax and structure of a Java program, including packages,
           classes, and methods.

5.Theory / Concept:
         -In Java, packages are used to group related classes and avoid naming conflicts. 
      	-A package is declared at the beginning of a Java file using the package keyword.  
      	-The import statement is used to include classes from different packages. 
      	-This practical demonstrates how to create and use packages, instantiate classes from different packages, and call their methods.

6.Algorithm:
        Step1: Create a package named a and define a class Test with methods print() and display().
        Step2: Create another package named b and define a class Test with a print() method.
        Step3: Create a main class App in the default package.
        Step4: Import both packages a and b in App.
        Step5: Instantiate objects of both a.Test and b.Test.
        Step6: Call the respective methods and observe the output.

 7.Source Code:
  // a.Test.java
         package a;
      
        public class Test{
        	void print(){
        		System.out.println("Hi from class Test in package a");
        	}
        	public void display(){
        		print();
        		System.out.println("Display: Hi from class Test in package a");
        	}
        }

    //b.Test.java
          package b;
        
          public class Test{
          	public void print(){
          		System.out.println("Hi from class Test in package b");
          	}
          }

    //App.java
          import a.*;
          import b.*;
          
          class App{
          	public static void main(String[] args){
          		a.Test t1=new a.Test();
          		b.Test t2=new b.Test();
          		
          		t1.display();
          		t2.print();
          	}
          }

8.Expected Output:
          Hi from class Test in package a
          Display: Hi from class Test in package a
          Hi from class Test in package b

 9.Observations:
      	- Encountered an ambiguity issue when importing a.* and b.* together. The solution was to use fully qualified names (a.Test and b.Test) when instantiating objects.
      	- Default access modifier restricts method access outside the package. Changing the print() method in a.Test to public resolves the issue.
      	- Java prevents name conflicts by requiring fully qualified names when classes have the same name in different packages.

10.Conclusion:
      	-This practical demonstrated the importance of packages in Java for organizing code and avoiding name conflicts.
      	-It also highlighted the role of access modifiers and how to handle naming collisions using fully qualified class names.
