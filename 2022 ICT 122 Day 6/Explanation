2. Title:- Constructors and Object Handling in Java
3. Date & Time:- 03.04.2025 1.30p.m to 3.30p.m

4. Objectives:- 
            Understand the concept of constructors in Java
            Learn how to create and initialize objects using default and parameterized constructors
            Demonstrate simple class interaction through method calls
            Practice object-oriented programming concepts

5. Theory / Concept:- 
            A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created. There are two main types of constructors:
            Default Constructor: Takes no parameters and initializes default values.
            Parameterized Constructor: Takes arguments and initializes object properties based on those.
            Additionally, methods in other classes (like the Printer class) can be used to interact with or display object data, showcasing modular and reusable code.

6. Algorithm / Flowchart:- 
              Steps to Follow:
                  Create the Students class with:
                  Fields: marks (int) and Name (String)
                  Constructors: default and parameterized
                  Create the Printer class with:
                  A method print(String x) to display a message
                  In the App class (with main() method):
                  Create an object of Printer and call its method
                  Create two Students objects using:
                  Default constructor (and set values later)
                  Parameterized constructor
                  Display each studentâ€™s name and marks using System.out.println()

9. Observations:- 
            The default constructor was successfully called and later modified using object reference.
            The parameterized constructor directly initialized the object with values.
            The Printer class showed basic class-to-class interaction using method calls.
            Demonstrated good understanding of OOP principles like encapsulation and modularity.

10. Conclusion:- 
            This practical effectively demonstrated how Java constructors (default and parameterized) 
            are used to initialize object data. It also showed how different classes can interact to 
            create a modular and maintainable structure.
