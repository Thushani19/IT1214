Objectives : To understand the fundamental structure of a basic Java program.
       including:-
          Importing packages
          Class declaration
          Main method structure
          Variable initialization
          Basic statements

Theory / Concept :In Java, all code resides within a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
     The basic syntax for declaring a class is:
           public class ClassName {
                // Class body
           }
           Main Method
           The main method serves as the entry point for Java applications. Its signature is:
               
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              // Program execution starts here
            }

Algorithm :
     Step1:Start.
     Step2:Define class One (not provided).
     Step3:Define class Two with instance variables and methods.
     Step4:Define class Num with the main method.
     Step5:Instantiate objects of One and Two.
     Step6:Assign values and call methods.
     Step7:End.

Source code :
         class One
        {
        	int a=10;
        	int b;
        	
        	void printDetails()
        	{
        		System.out.println("Fron Class One a ="+a);
        		System.out.println("Fron Class One b ="+b);
        	}
        }
        
        class Two
        {
        	int a,c;
        	void printDetails()
      	{
      		System.out.println("Fron Class Two a ="+a);
      		System.out.println("Fron Class Two c ="+c);
      	}
      }
      
      class App
      {
      	public static void main (String args[])
      	{
      		One o1=new One();
      		Two t1=new Two();
      		
      		o1.printDetails();
      		o1.b=50;
      		o1.printDetails();
      		t1.printDetails();
      		t1.a=10;
      		t1.c=30;
      		t1.printDetails();
      	}
      }

Output :Fron Class One a =10
        Fron Class One b =0
        Fron Class One a =10
        Fron Class One b =50
        Fron Class Two a =0
        Fron Class Two c =0
        Fron Class Two a =10
        Fron Class Two c =30

Conclusion :I learnt how to get the input from the user and give the output in java.
