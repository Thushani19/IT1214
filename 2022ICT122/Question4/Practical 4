Objectives : To understand the fundamental structure of a basic Java program.
       including:-
          Importing packages
          Class declaration
          Main method structure
          Variable initialization
          Basic statements

Theory / Concept :In Java, all code resides within a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
     The basic syntax for declaring a class is:
           public class ClassName {
                // Class body
           }
           Main Method
           The main method serves as the entry point for Java applications. Its signature is:
               
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              // Program execution starts here
            }

Algorithm :
     Start.
     Define class One (not provided).
     Define class Two with instance variables and methods.
     Define class Num with the main method.
     Instantiate objects of One and Two.
     Assign values and call methods.
     End.

Source code :
         class One
        {
        	int a=10;
        	int b;
        	
        	void printDetails()
        	{
        		System.out.println("Fron Class One a ="+a);
        		System.out.println("Fron Class One b ="+b);
        	}
        }
        
        class Two
        {
        	int a,c;
        	void printDetails()
      	{
      		System.out.println("Fron Class Two a ="+a);
      		System.out.println("Fron Class Two c ="+c);
      	}
      }
      
      class App
      {
      	public static void main (String args[])
      	{
      		One o1=new One();
      		Two t1=new Two();
      		
      		o1.printDetails();
      		o1.b=50;
      		o1.printDetails();
      		t1.printDetails();
      		t1.a=10;
      		t1.c=30;
      		t1.printDetails();
      	}
      }

Output :Fron Class One a =10
        Fron Class One b =0
        Fron Class One a =10
        Fron Class One b =50
        Fron Class Two a =0
        Fron Class Two c =0
        Fron Class Two a =10
        Fron Class Two c =30

Conclusion :I learnt how to get the input from the user and give the output in java.
