Objectives : To understand the fundamental structure of a basic Java program, 
     including:
          Importing packages
          Class declaration
          Main method structure
          Variable initialization
          Basic statements

Theory / Concept :In Java, all code resides within a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
The basic syntax for declaring a class is:
               public class ClassName {
                   // Class body
               }
               Main Method
               The main method serves as the entry point for Java applications. Its signature is:
               
               public static void main(String[] args) {
                   // Program execution starts here
               }
Algorithm :
     Step1:START
     Step2:INPUT ar;
     Step3:PRINT ar[0]," ",ar[2]," "+ar[1];
     Step4:END

Source code :
         import java.io.*;

         class MyThirdClass
         {
          	public static void main(String[] ar)
          {
          	System.out.println(ar[0]+" "+ar[2]+" "+ar[1]);
          
          		
          }
          }

    //mythirdclass :How are you
    //output:How you are

Output :How you are
Conclusion :I learnt how to get the input from the user and give the output in java.
