Objectives : To understand the fundamental structure of a basic Java program.
     including:
          Importing packages
          Class declaration
          Main method structure
          Variable initialization
          Basic statements

Theory / Concept :
     public: Allows access from outside the class.
     static: Enables execution without creating an object.
     void: Indicates no return value.
     String[] args: Holds command-line arguments.

Algorithm :
     Step1:START
     Step2:INPUT args;
     Step3:PRINT "The first argument is ",(args[ 0]);
     Step4:PRINT "The second argument is ",(args[ 1]);
     Step5:PRINT "The third argument is ",(args[ 2]);
     Step6:END

Source code :
          import java.io.*;
          
          class MySecondClass
          {
          	public static void main(String[] args)
          	{
          		System.out.print("The first argument is "+args[ 0]);
          		System.out.print("The second argument is "+args[ 1]);
          		System.out.print(" The thirt argument is "+args[ 2]);
          		
          	}
          }
Output :The first argument is Hi.The second argument is I'm The thirt argument is Shakthy
Conclusion :I learnt how to get the input from the user and give the output in java.
