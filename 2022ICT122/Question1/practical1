Objectives : To understand basic syntax and structure of a java program.

Theory / Concept :Java programs consist of classes & methods, Every application has a main method where execution begins.
   	 Explanation:
		public: Allows access from outside the class.
		static: Enables execution without creating an object.
		void: Indicates no return value.
		String[] args: Holds command-line arguments.

Algorithm :
     Step1:START
     Step2:PRINT "Hi This is IT1214 practical session1 This print next line This is in a new line ";
     Step3:END

Source code :
	import java.io.*;
	
	class MyFirstClass
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.print("Hi ");
			System.out.print("This is IT1214 practical session1 ");
			System.out.print("This print next line ");
			System.out.print("This is in a new line ");
		}
	}

Output : Hi This is IT1214 practical session1 This print next line This is in a new line.

Conclusion :I learnt about the java programming.
