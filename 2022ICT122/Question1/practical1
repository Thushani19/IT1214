Objectives : To understand basic syntax and structure of a java program.

Theory / Concept :Java programs consist of classes & methods, Every application has a main method where execution begins.
Explanation:
public: Allows access from outside the class.
static: Enables execution without creating an object.
void: Indicates no return value.
String[] args: Holds command-line arguments.

Algorithm :
     Step1:START
     Step2:PRINT "Hi This is IT1214 practical session1 This print next line This is in a new line ";
     Step3:END
Source code :
import java.io.*;

class MyFirstClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.print("Hi ");
		System.out.print("This is IT1214 practical session1 ");
		System.out.print("This print next line ");
		System.out.print("This is in a new line ");
	}
}
Output : Hi This is IT1214 practical session1 This print next line This is in a new line.
Conclusion :I learnt about the java programming.
